# Plotly maps and dashboard with Streamlit

This repo contains a dashboard app that demonstrates the use of Plotly Chorpleths and Scatter maps and 
constructs a CO2 emissions dashboard and support the Medium article [__How to create a simple GIS map with Plotly and Streamlit__](#)

The app is in the Streamlit Communitiy Cloud and can be found [here](https://co2-dashboard.streamlit.app/). 

The Streamlit app consists of the file _Main.py_ and the program files in the _pages_ folder.

Here are a couple of screenshots of the dashboard.
